# JBomb the Game Launcher

This Java-based launcher was designed to manage dependencies, check for updates, and launch the JBomb game. However, with the release of JBomb on Steam, this launcher is no longer actively maintained or in production.

**Note:** If you're looking to play JBomb, we recommend downloading it directly from Steam for the latest updates and features.
